# 🎓 CertiChain: Blockchain-Based Certificate Verification System

*CertiChain* is a hybrid certificate issuance and verification platform that combines the speed of *MongoDB* with the immutable security of *Ethereum Blockchain*. It prevents certificate forgery by storing a unique SHA-256 cryptographic fingerprint (hash) of each certificate on the blockchain.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

•⁠  ⁠*Immutable Proof:* Each certificate hash is locked onto the blockchain, making it impossible to alter or fake.
•⁠  ⁠*Hybrid Verification:* Performs a dual-check against MongoDB records and Blockchain state.
•⁠  ⁠*QR Code Integration:* Instant verification via QR scanning using ⁠ jsQR ⁠ and ⁠ Jimp ⁠.
•⁠  ⁠*Data Integrity:* Implements SHA-256 hashing with data normalization to prevent false "Tampering" alerts.
•⁠  ⁠*Role-Based Access:* Managed access for Admins (Approvers), Issuers (Universities), and Students.
•⁠  ⁠*Disaster Recovery Ready:* Provision for IPFS CID storage for decentralized backup.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

•⁠  ⁠*Backend:* Node.js, Express.js
•⁠  ⁠*Database:* MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
•⁠  ⁠*Blockchain:* Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js (v6)
•⁠  ⁠*Network:* Sepolia Testnet / Hardhat Local Node
•⁠  ⁠*Security:* SHA-256 Hashing, JWT Authentication, ⁠ onlyOwner ⁠ Smart Contract Modifiers.

## 🏗 System Architecture

1.⁠ ⁠*Issuance:* Issuer generates a certificate  System creates a SHA-256 hash:


2.⁠ ⁠*Blockchain Write:* The hash is sent to the Smart Contract's ⁠ issueCertificate ⁠ function.
3.⁠ ⁠*Storage:* Metadata is saved in MongoDB; Transaction Hash is linked to the record.
4.⁠ ⁠*Verification:* * Data is pulled from MongoDB via ⁠ populate('studentId') ⁠.
•⁠  ⁠A fresh hash is generated from current data.
•⁠  ⁠The system compares the fresh hash with the hash stored on the Blockchain.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Blockchain Setup

⁠ bash
cd blockchain
npm install
# Start local node
npx hardhat node
# Deploy contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

 ⁠

### 2. Backend Setup

1.⁠ ⁠Create a ⁠ .env ⁠ file in the ⁠ backend ⁠ folder:

⁠ env
PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
PRIVATE_KEY=your_account_0_private_key
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=deployed_contract_address

 ⁠

2.⁠ ⁠Start the server:

⁠ bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

 ⁠

## 📝 Smart Contract Logic

The core logic resides in ⁠ CertificateRegistry.sol ⁠:

•⁠  ⁠⁠ mapping(string => CertData) certificates ⁠: Stores data against a unique UUID.
•⁠  ⁠⁠ issueCertificate() ⁠: Restricted to the contract owner (Backend wallet).
•⁠  ⁠⁠ getCertificate() ⁠: Public function to fetch the on-chain proof.
